# Roadmap

This roadmap defines our current view on how we will continue with the development of JSON Forms on a very coarse-grained level and is subject to change at any time:

H2/2021
 * Switch to ESM Modules for better consumability
 * Improve overall rendering performance
 * Improve Documentation

H1/2022
 * Improve extensbility by introducing middleware layer
